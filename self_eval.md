# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled a bit with the hashes 2 assignment and figuring out how to incorporate iterations with hashes. I learned that with hashes you need to use #{} when inserting the value and the key into whatever you'd like the output to be.


- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note taking is going well but I'd like to go back through my notes and summarize things. I think my notes are a little messy and I'd like to create a "mod0 study guide". I take the most helpful notes when I'm reading through the lessons and working on the CFUs.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I definitely try to solve it on my own first. There's some satisfaction that comes from just trying and trying on your own. But I know when to turn to google!
